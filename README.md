# Awesome WM shortcuts/functions

My configuration for keyboard shortcuts.
Need to be added to `/bin`. Press `Super + r` to goto command mode and enter following commands.

#### Volume Manager
`v [percentage]`
`v m` to mute, `v u` to unmute

#### Brightness Manager
`b [percentage]`

#### Other shortcuts
`s`: sudo
`die`: instant shutdown

#### Multi-display
`rsd` (Reset Displays): Adds 2 monitors along with the primary display.
`kd` (Kill displays): Well, self explanatory :P
